//Note to next session:
//Working on Chapter 3.5 Loops - While and For
//I skipped the 2.9 and 2.10 exercises, but those would be good for understanding how to work with bits in C

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

    int bit1 = 0;
    int bit2 = 2;

    printf("%d\n", bit2<<2);
    printf("%d", bit1 && bit2);

}
